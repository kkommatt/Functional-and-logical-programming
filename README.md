# Functional and logical programming
Labs for course "Functional and logical programming"

Lab1_1: Leave in the list the items that have an even number of occurrences in the list.

Lab1_2: Divide the list into two lists according to the condition "to be or not to be a power of 2". The list consists of integers, the order of the elements must be preserved.

Lab2: Split the given list into several sublists so that the last sublist contains 1^1 elements in the penultimate one - 2^2 elements from the end of the list, etc.

Lab3: For a given natural number k, find all words of length k that are allowed by a finite automaton.

Lab4: Provide an equivalent transformation of an irreducible grammar in order to eliminate rules of the form X â†’ Y, where Y is a nonterminal symbol (removal of unit products).
