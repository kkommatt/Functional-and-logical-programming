# Functional and logical programming
Labs for course "Functional and logical programming"

Lab1_1: Leave in the list the items that have an even number of occurrences in the list.

Lab1_2: Divide the list into two lists according to the condition "to be or not to be a power of 2". The list consists of integers, the order of the elements must be preserved.

Lab2: Split the given list into several sublists so that the last sublist contains 1^1 elements in the penultimate one - 2^2 elements from the end of the list, etc.

Lab3: For a given natural number k, find all words of length k that are allowed by a finite automaton.

Lab4: Provide an equivalent transformation of an irreducible grammar in order to eliminate rules of the form X â†’ Y, where Y is a nonterminal symbol (removal of unit products).

Lab5: Program and test three unary Maybe-functions to evaluate the three expressions given by the option, choosing your number in the list of two academic groups as a constant n. (The only argument of the functions here is x). (2 points).
Program a Maybe-function using monadic operations and test it to compute the superposition of the three functions from paragraph 1), with the first function acting as the outer function and the last function as the inner function:
represent the desired function using do-notation (1 point).
represent the desired function without using do-notation. (1 point).
Program and test a binary Maybe-function to evaluate the last of the three expressions given by the variant, considering n as an argument that takes real values. (1 point).
Program and test the Maybe-function using monadic operations to compute the following superposition when the first function from paragraph 1) is substituted for the binary function mentioned above (in paragraph 3) instead of its first argument, and the second function is substituted for the second argument:
the desired function is represented using do-notation (1 point).
represent the desired function without using do-notation (2 points).

Lab6: Development of a simple expert system
